/**
 * @title BitcoinPodManager
 * @notice Manages Bitcoin custody pods for Clients in the BitDSM protocol
 * @dev Handles pod creation, deposits, withdrawals and pod state management
 *
 * The BitcoinPodManager contract provides the following key functionality:
 * - Pod creation and management
 * - Bitcoin deposit and withdrawal request handling for each pod 
 * - Integration with BitDSM Service Manager for operator actions
 * - Pod delegation to apps
 
 *
 * Key components:
 * - BitcoinPod: Individual custody pods that hold Bitcoin
 * - BitDSMServiceManager: Manages operator tasks and verification
 * - AppRegistry: Verifies and delegates to/from registered applications
 *
 * Security features:
 * - Reentrancy protection on state-modifying functions
 * - Access control via modifiers
 * - Circuit breaker (pause) functionality
 * - Pod ownership verification
 * - App verification through App Registry
 *
 * State Management:
 * - Tracks user to pod mappings
 * - Tracks pod to app mappings  
 * - Tracks deposit requests per pod
 * - Tracks withdrawal addresses per pod
 *
 * Key flows:
 * 1. Pod Creation
 *    - User requests for pod creation with a selected operator
 *    - User and operator needs to create a Bitcoin Multisig address beforehand
 *    - Manager verifies operator and creates new BitcoinPod contract
 *    - Transfers ownership of Pod to the user
 *
 * 2. Deposits
 *    - User initiates deposit verification request
 *    - Operator verifies the bitcoin deposit on Bitcoin Network
 *    - Manager updates pod balance
 *
 * 3. Withdrawals  
 *    - User initiates withdrawal request
 *    - Operator signs withdrawal transaction
 *    - Manager facilitates withdrawal completion
