 * Key features:
 * - Secure storage of operator Bitcoin public keys
 * - Validation of Bitcoin public key format
 * - Integration with EigenLayer staking

 * The contract works in conjunction with:
 * - BitDSMServiceManager: For operator task management
 * - BitcoinPodManager: For pod operations
 * - EigenLayer: For staking and delegation
